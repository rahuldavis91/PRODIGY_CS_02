# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

A simple Python tool for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. This tool features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`, allowing users to apply basic operations like swapping pixel values or performing simple mathematical operations to encrypt and decrypt images.

## Features

- **Image Encryption:** Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
- **Image Decryption:** Decrypt images to restore the original content.
- **Graphical User Interface:** User-friendly interface built with `tkinter`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- `Pillow` (Python Imaging Library, installable via `pip`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahuldavis91/image_encryption_tool.py
